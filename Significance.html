            <p>Differences</p>
            <li>In the Islamic faith their understanding of sin is anything that goes against the commands of God. In the Adventist church, “sin is the ethical, moral, mental, and spiritual decomposition of the human being, originally created in the image of God”.(What Is Sin in the Adventist Faith - Google Search, n.d.)</li>
            <li>The understanding behind the consequences of sin in the Islamic faith is that if your evil deeds outweigh your good deeds then you will be punished by God on the Day of Judgement. This means that the deeds we do/the actions that we make, hold our fate in terms of how God or “Allah” sees fit.</li>
            <li>In the Adventist church, the consequences of sin is death and because humanity has fallen to sin the punishment is inevitable. Both religious faiths have different insights on their understanding concerning the consequences of sin. Muslims believe that your deeds determine your salvation whereas Adventists believe that your choice (to follow Jesus or not) determines your salvation.

            <p><h3>Adventists Significance of Salvation</h3></p>
          
            <p>In Adventism, salvation is an essential part of their belief. In my first part I mention that the 8th fundamental belief details how:
“humanity is now involved in a great controversy between Christ and Satan regarding the character of God, his law, and his overall sovereignty of the universe.” (What Do Seventh Day Adventists Really Believe?, 2019). As mentioned in this line its basically saying that “Satan challenges God’s law, his character, and his sovereignty over all creation”. It is through this line that Adventists believe this is how Satan birthed sin. Satan’s name in hebrew translates to “accuser” or “adversary”, so in this line it details the very emphasis of Satans nature which is to accuse God and create a false image of God.
In my first part I also mention that because of the influence of sin we are punished with the eternal consequences of death (Romans 6:23). John 3:16 talks about how God sent his son to act on God’s behalf, to show humanity that there is a way to avoid the consequences of our sin. God sends his son to prove to humanity that Satans accusations of God are false. Satan tries to end this by killing Jesus on the cross, but as the story goes Jesus overcomes death and comes back to life. So even though the consequences of sin is death, Jesus (who was without sin) creates a new path for humanity to take, the road that leads to eternal life. In relation to the first part of the significance of salvation, God sends his son to act as Justice in terms of what Satan is accusing God of. A God who is unfair. By accusing God of doing things that oppose his very being, Adventism teaches that Satan is the great accuser who tries to disfigure the entirety of God’s very existance. Adventists believe that Jesus proves God’s innocence by taking away the punishment which humanity deserves. Jesus dies in our place and creates an opportunity for all of mankind to be saved. “For whoever believes in him shall not ‘perish’, but have ‘everlasting life’”, this last part from the scripture of John 3:16 further explains the sacrifice that Jesus made. Believe in Christ and you will be saved, or in other words believe in Christ and what he stood for.  The plan for salvation was to prove that Satan was wrong and that God was indeed fair, that his law was just, and that he had authority over all creation.
So how is salvation significant in Adventism? Well, salvation takes up a seventh of the total 28 Fundamental beliefs. These four beliefs focus on the salvation that is bought through Jesus Christ and because of this, it gives evidence that salvation is indeed important in Adventism. But salvation isn’t just found within those four beliefs, salvation is actually interwoven within each and every fundamental belief of the Adventist Church. Fundamental no.19: The law of God, relates to how salvation was trying to prove that God’s law is jsut and fair. Fundamental belief no.22: Christian Behavior, talks about how God calls us to be godly people and act in harmony with biblical principles in all aspects of a personal and social life (What Do Seventh Day Adventists Really Believe?, 2019). So as a matter of fact, salvation is a stronghold on what the Adventist Church believes in.</p>

          <p><h3>Islam's Significance of Salvation</h3></p>
          
          <p>
            Sin was an act of rebellion caused by Adam and Eve when they disobeyed God. After this, we as human beings are not born with sin and instead, we are given the choice to do what is right or what is wrong.
Through these lines this indicates a connection to the four pathways that the Qur’an suggests leads to salvation. (Salvation in the Qur’an, n.d.)
Belief
The Qur’an teaches that only believers will be saved and that those who do not believe will be condemned.
Works
The Qur’an teaches that all our good deeds, good or evil, will be weighed in a balance, and our eternal destiny is based on whether or not our good deeds outweigh our bad ones.
Repentance
This pathway references how the Qur’an mentions Allah’s mercy, forgiveness and compassion. 39:53 Qur’an in short says; “Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.”
Predestination
At the core of Islamic theology, in accordance to the Qur’an which teaches that everything which happens is by the will of Allah. Therefore, this implies that our salvation is also by the will of Allah or in simpler terms, our salvation is predetermined.
So how is salvation significant in Islam? 
Through the five pillars of Islam, Muslims construct themselves on these things in order to keep the Islamic faith.  It is identified within the phrase “La ilaha illa Allah Muhammad Rasul-ul-Allah” which translates to “There is no one but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God”. Muslims repeatedly say this phrase in their prayers each day. This is linked to their idea of a profession of faith (shahada - the first pillar of Islam).
In relation to the four pathways, the first three all coexist within many passages from the Qur’an such as ; “Ordain for us what is good in this life and the next…we have turned to you in repentance…we who believe in your signs” (7:156). This verse emphasises on the belief, the works, and the repentance parts of the four pathways that salvation offers in the Islamic faith. Our good deeds and our belief in Allah, as well as our ever present repentance for our sins is a key factor in salvation for Muslims. Predestination relates to the will of Allah and how our lives are predetermined in reference to ‘Paradise’. In other words, our good deeds in a way determine our salvation but it is ultimately up to the will and the sovereignty of Allah that allows Muslims to be saved/predestined to Paradise.
In recognition on the importance of salvation within the Islamic faith, salvation is indeed significant and is indeed important.
