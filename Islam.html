        <div class="paragraph_one">
            <p>Muslims believe that salvation is “the eventual entrance to paradise” and paradise is described by the Islamic word “Jannah” which translates to “paradise garden”. It is described in the Holy book titled the Quran as an “eternal afterlife of peace and bliss” (Website, n.d.-a: What is paradise?). As I venture further on towards the study of salvation, I will explain the belief system around salvation from a Muslim's point of view.
In the Islamic faith, the source of origin for their beliefs and pillars is centred around the Quran and the Hadith. The Quran or Koran is believed to be the sacred scripture of Islam. It is believed by all Muslims that the Quran was given to the Prophet Muhammed at a place called “Mecca” where he received a vision from God and was given the message of Islam to spread to all mankind.
</p>
            <p>The Hadith is believed to be “a record of the words, actions, and the silent approval of the Islamic prophet Muhammed as transmitted by many narrators' “ (Understanding behind the Hadith Website, n.d.-b). Both books highlight the key ideas of the Islamic faith and how they have a link to salvation, concerning a Muslim idea of it. Concerning salvation and what Muslims believe about it, it is said that they believe that non-muslims who die believing in God but disbelieving in his message (the message of Islam), are left to his will. In other words, to enter “paradise” a person must believe in God and in the message of Islam. If a person who identifies as a non-muslim, believes in God, and yet disbelieves the message of Islam, they are then said to be left to the will of God. Meaning if God says yes then you may enter and if he says no then you may not enter. In saying this, Muslims believe that through believing in God and the message of Islam they are saved by the will of “Allah” through obedience of his law. But in saying so it is not easily attainable as it prescribes. Another source claims that in the Islamic faith, they believe that no one can gain salvation simply by their belief in God or their deeds, instead, it is the mercy of God. The need for salvation is also founded by works/righteousness through Allah. But that is not always the case. According to Answering Islam: a christian-muslim dialog, it talks about the Qur’an suggesting four pathways to salvation: belief, works, repentance, and predestination. (Salvation in the Qur’an, n.d.) So the Islamic faith has many pathways in regards to salvation.</p>
