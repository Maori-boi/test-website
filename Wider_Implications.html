            <p>Salvation through faith or Salvation through works - society:</p>
<p>When discussing the differences and the similarities between the two religious beliefs, we can identify that in Adventism they believe that Salvation is achieved through faith in God whereas in Islam they believe that Salvation is achieved through works and faith. In today's world, we can see the controversial hustle between the two ideas on how a person can receive or achieve salvation. For people who seem unsure on what religious belief system they want to follow/adhere to, let's give a clear view on the differences between the two religious beliefs in terms of how Salvation is achieved. 
Through Adventism, believers adhere to the idea of salvation through faith. They believe that salvation is accomplished by having faith and believing in the life, death, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Adventism teaches that it is through grace by faith in Jesus Christ that we receive the salvation available for all people. If we compare it to society, the Adventist view on how salvation is available concludes that in order to be saved, all you need to do is believe in Jesus and the teachings that he taught. But in saying this, Adventists do not force Jesus into people, instead Adventists adhere to the most precious gift God gave us. Free Will. Through this teaching, society is given the choice of free will whether to accept the gift of salvation or not.
In comparison to an Islamic view, muslims believe that in order to gain salvation it is through works by righteousness and the essential belief of one God. The Islamic teachings say that salvation is attainable through sincere worship and complete submission to God. So when contributing to society, the Islamic belief details that salvation can be achieved by works through righteousness. Likewise with Adventism, Islam also grants people the choice of free will. Qur’an, Ayah al-Baqarah  2:256 essentially says that no one is compelled to adopt Islam as his or her religion. Through this teaching, society is given the choice of free will, whether to follow Islam or not.
Through these two different views on how salvation can be received, people are able to choose whichever side they want to follow. Both religious beliefs adhere to the teachings of “Free Will”.

            <p>Wars; differences in beliefs – political:</p>
<p>In terms of a political view, salvation within the two different religious beliefs also deal with conflict of interests. In terms of a political stance, this wider implication can relate to past events such as the crusades, which can cause disagreements and conflicts within different religious beliefs. In relation to political events let me insight you on the events of the crusades. The crusades was a conflict between christians and muslims that started primarily to secure control of specific areas that were considered holy and sacred to both groups. This political debacle flared into a war that raged on for more than 100 years over pieces of land. So as we can see, even religious beliefs can create conflicts in relation to what they believe in or what they stand for. Concerning the two religious beliefs (Adventism and Islam) there can be conflicts between the ideas that are presented through salvation. Adventists believe that Jesus is the son of God and the remedy for sin whereas muslims believe that Jesus is a prophet that was given divine power by God.

            <p>Personal: a reflection on salvation through these two religious beliefs</p>
<p>When being presented with the ideas of salvation concerning these two religious beliefs, I can see that both religious beliefs do not force upon people to choose their specific faith. Both religions offer the choice of free will to all people who are willing to choose whether or not to accept salvation. I like that both religions have a similar idea on salvation and yet they differ from how to achieve salvation itself. Their ideas are authentic and relevant to their belief system.
As an Adventist myself, I adhere to salvation through faith in Jesus rather than through the Islamic concept. Not to be biassed or anything but that is what I strongly believe in. When comparing the Islamic concept of salvation to my life I act upon the works through righteousness, meaning that my actions are done according to what the Lord requires of me (Micah 6:8). So in a way a take some understanding from the Islamic faith as well as my Adventist faith.
