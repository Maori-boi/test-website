        <div class="paragraph_one">
            <p>Adventists believe that salvation is not a works-based doctrine but they see salvation as an action, that through the Grace that God showed us on the Cross and the faith that we have in him, we are saved (Ephesians 2:8). It is because of this belief that we can understand the Adventist concept of salvation and create a more in-depth understanding of it.</p>
            <p>Concerning salvation, the Adventist church dictates its beliefs around the Bible and the Bible alone (What Adventists Believe About the Holy Scriptures, 2021). It is through the Bible that Adventists receive the cause and reasoning for salvation. The cause is the influence of sin (Genesis 3) and the need for salvation is to be saved from the eternal consequences of death (Romans 6:23). The plan of salvation was premeditated before the world was created as a ‘backup’ in terms of Lucifer/Satan’s betrayal. This was identified by Adventist pioneer Ellen.G.White who wrote the book titled “The Great Controversy”, which is also a part of the 28 Fundamental Beliefs in the Adventist church. The belief details how “humanity is now involved in a great controversy between Christ and Satan regarding the character of God, his law, and his overall sovereignty of the universe.” (What Do Seventh Day Adventists Really Believe?, 2019) The conflict originated in heaven through a created being who, like us, was given the choice of free will and instead used this to exalt himself above God. He questioned the entirety of God’s “great love” that eventually led to his downfall and the corruption that he brought upon God’s creation (sin). This is the event that brought the plan of salvation into action. With the freedom that God embedded into all mankind, we chose the path that rode away from our oneness with God. Through our disobedience, humanity was now bound together by the shackles of sin. It is through our ‘humanity’ that we strayed away from what was best for us and also birthed the identity of sin into all mankind. essentially means that man was now born with sin and that we are not born innocent or free from sin but instead now “slaves to sin” (John 8:34).</p>
            <p>The answer for salvation is further described in the 9th fundamental belief in the Adventist church. This fundamental belief details the “Life, Death, and the Resurrection of Christ” and how his passionate love for humanity brought the antidote for sin. His life was set as a way to experience sin as a human being, in doing so he sacrificed his omnipresence which allowed him to be anywhere/everywhere at the same time. His transformation to flesh led to the containment of his being which was the first time that the “trinity” was separated throughout the entire existence of the universe. The purpose of salvation can be explained as follows: God’s wrath was made to eradicate sin, so Jesus became sin and eradicated sin when he died. This showed the lengths of God’s love for us in terms of an Adventist’s view on salvation.</p>
            <p>Fundamental beliefs 10 and 11 further explain the need and the relevance of salvation. Belief No.10 centred itself around the experience of salvation which is important in terms of an Adventist person. It is described in this fundamental belief that “Through Christ, we are justified, adopted as God’s sons and daughters, and delivered from the lordship of sin”. (What Do Seventh Day Adventists Really Believe?, 2019) This belief centres itself at the stronghold of Christ's sacrifice on the cross. Adventists believe that it is through his infinite love and mercy that God made Christ an example of Satan's so-called accusations on the character, the law, and the overall sovereignty of God, false. Belief No.11 further exemplifies the Adventist view on a relationship with Christ who is the very foundation of salvation in the Adventist Church. It is titled “Growing in Christ'' and details the offer of salvation to all people who are willing to accept it. The choice of free will is underlined in this Illustration of God’s great love for us which links itself to the action of salvation. It is through God's great love that he does not force salvation upon us but instead gives us the choice to either accept it or not.</p>
